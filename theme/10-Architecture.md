# Architecture

## The entry-point

The application entry point (located in `src/app/index.js`) includes Redux provider declaration and the application router inclusion.

In this file the `process.env.NODE_ENV` based tools are configured:

1.  The hot reload configuration for `development`

2.  The ReactDevTools disabled for `production`

## The main router

The application router (located in `src/app/route/index.js`) is responsible for application routing. It is implemented using `react-router-dom`. Routes are declared inside of the `Switch` which means there is only one route visible at any point of the time.

Router controls the mounting of following components:

-   `HomePage`,

-   `TestPage`,

-   `CategoryPage`,

-   `ProductPage`,

-   `CmsPage`,

-   `CartPage`,

-   `CheckoutPage`, 

-   `NoMatch`. 

At the same time it contains initialization of `Header`, `Footer`, `Breadcrumbs` and `NotificationList` components
regardless the requested URL path. Those components are always visible during navigation within the application.

From the data perspective, the application common data is also requested: the CMS blocks for Footer and complete Menu.
 The `HeaderAndFooter` store is being used for that.

> **This is the place, where the first request to `GraphQL` starts it\`s way**. There must be 2 requests in total for initial rendering: one for common data between all pages (controlled by `HeaderAndFooter` store) and the second for any page related content (requested from upper mentioned components).
>
> Please note, that at this point `HeaderAndFooter` dispatcher is dispatching the `CmsBlocksAndSlider` action. All CMS blocks are available via global state property `blocks`.

Below is the routing map:

| Mounted component | URL path    | Is exact? |
| ----------------- | ----------- | --------- |
| HomePage          | `/`         | yes       |
| CategoryPage      | `/category` | no        |
| ProductPage       | `/product`  | no        |
| CmsPage           | `/page/:id` | no        |
| CartPage          | `/cart`     | yes       |
| CheckoutPage      | `/checkout` | yes       |
| NoMatch           | –           | no        |

> Notice the URL parameter is not set for the `/category` and `/product` – which means **there will be no URL params directly available in URL for `CategoryPage` and `ProductPage` components**. This is done because we would not like to limit the possible category nesting (for example: `/category/main/sub/sub`). We are using `Url` module from `src/app/util/Url` in order to resolve the path.
>
> The URL param is present in `CmsPage`. We have left it, because it allowed for more "transparent" implementation of CMS page functionality. 

This part of the application might be a topic of changes in the future.

## The main store

The application main store combines all of the available reducers. Additionally, it makes sure that the ReduxDevTools will be disabled in production.

> Please, **keep action names and global state properties unique to every store**. This is important, because we are
> using only one provider for the application. This means all actions will be combined along with all global state properties.

The included reducers are:

-   `CmsBlocksAndSliderReducer`,

-   `CmsPageReducer`,

-   `CategoryReducer`,

-   `NotificationReducer`,

-   `BreadcrumbsReducer`,

-   `ProductReducer`,

-   `HeaderAndFooterReducer`,

-   `CartReducer`,

-   `NoMatchReducer`,

-   `RelatedProductsReducer`.

As you may see, most of Reducers are related to one specific component. Here is detailed connections between store and related component:

| Reducer name              | Declared state properties                                                                | State listening component(s)                                       | Action dispatching component(s)                                 | Notes for developers                                                                                                                                      |
