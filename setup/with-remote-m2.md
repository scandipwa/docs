# Setting up the theme with remote M2 server

This type of installation is helpful, when your aim is NOT to develop a backend functionality, rather only modify frontend.

While using this setup:

1. ScandiPWA theme is run by `wepack-dev-server`
2. All `/graphql` requests are sent to your remote server
3. There is an Nginx routing the requests

> **Note**: it is impossible to test the website in production mode (of the webpack build). This is the main downside of this approach.

> **Note**: the `https://scandipwa.local` wont be available. The PWA features will not function.

<hr>

In code examples, you might stumble across such declaration:

```bash
# to clone the fork
git clone git@github.com:<YOUR GITHUB USERNAME>/scandipwa-base.git
```

> **Note**: the `<YOUR GITHUB USERNAME>` is not a literal text to keep, but the "template" to replace with the real value.

## Before you start

1. If you plan to make changes to the theme make sure to [create GitHub account](https://github.com/join), or [sign in](https://github.com/login) into existing one.

    1. Make sure you have a SSH key assigned to your GitHub account, and you current machine has the same key. Read [how to setup SSH key on GitHub](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account).

    2. Make sure to fork [`scandipwa-base` repository](https://github.com/scandipwa/base-theme). Read [how to fork repository on GitHub](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo).

2. Make sure your remote server has ScandiPWA installed on it

    The Magento theme could be different, but ScandiPWA modules should be installed and enabled. Read more how to install the ScandiPWA on existing Magento 2 server [here](./on-existing-m2.md).

    In case you do not have the ScandiPWA instance yet, try completing this setup using our instances: `demo.scandipwa.com` or `scandipwapmrev.indvp.com`. You can also request your own cloud instance by composing a mail to hello@scandipwa.com.

3. Make sure you have an nginx installed locally. To test this, run:

    ```bash
    nginx -t # it should be ^1
    ```

    In case this command resulted in error, install the nginx [on Mac](https://medium.com/@ThomasTan/installing-nginx-in-mac-os-x-maverick-with-homebrew-d8867b7e8a5a) or [on Linux](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-nginx-on-ubuntu-18-04)

4. Make sure you have `node` available on you machine. To test this, run:

    ```bash
    node -v # should be 10^
    ```

    In case this command resulted in error, install node using the [official guide](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/). Prefer `nvm` installation to get NODE version 10 specifically.

5. Execute following command to add `scandipwa.local` to your `/etc/hosts` file and map it to the `127.0.0.1`:

    ```bash
    echo '127.0.0.1 scandipwa.local' | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
    ```

## It is time to configure nginx!

Add nginx configuration file.

1. To do this, first check the location of nginx configuration file:

    ```bash
    nginx -t

    # expected output (on Mac)
    nginx: the configuration file /usr/local/etc/nginx/nginx.conf syntax is ok
    nginx: configuration file /usr/local/etc/nginx/nginx.conf test is successful
    ```

2. Now, find the directory where nginx configurations are stored:

    ```bash
    cat /usr/local/etc/nginx/nginx.conf | grep include

    # expected output (on Mac)
    include       mime.types;
    include servers/*; # <- you need this one
    ```

3. Create new file there, using following command:

    ```bash
    touch servers/scandipwa-remote.conf
    ```

4. Open this file using your favorite editor and past following content inside (do not forget to replace the placeholders!):

    ```nginx
    server {
        listen 80;
        server_name _;
        resolver 127.0.0.11;

        # Route all traffic to app
        location / {
            proxy_pass http://localhost:3003;
            proxy_http_version 1.1;
            proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
            proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
            proxy_set_header Host             $http_host;
            proxy_set_header X-Real-IP        $remote_addr;
            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For  $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
            proxy_redirect off;
            proxy_read_timeout 600s;
        }

        location ~* /graphql {
            proxy_pass http://<REMOTE SERVERDOMAIN>:80;
            proxy_set_header Host             <REMOTE SERVER DOMAIN>;
            proxy_set_header X-Real-IP        $remote_addr;
            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For  $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
            proxy_redirect off;
            proxy_read_timeout 600s;
        }

        location ~* /(static|media|admin) {
            proxy_pass http://<REMOTE SERVERDOMAIN>:80;
            proxy_set_header Host             <REMOTE SERVER DOMAIN>;
            proxy_set_header X-Real-IP        $remote_addr;
            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For  $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
            proxy_redirect off;
            proxy_read_timeout 600s;
        }
    }
    ```

5. Test and reload the `nginx` service:

    ```bash
    # to test the configuration
    nginx -t

    # reload the configuration
    nginx -s reload
    ```

## Time to decide - core or custom?

The theme can be developed in two modes - as contribution into core theme, or as custom theme development on top of core theme. Let's review each one:

### For ScandiPWA core contribution

1. Get the copy of `base-theme` - clone your fork, or clone the original repository.

    ```bash
    # to clone the fork
    git clone git@github.com:<YOUR GITHUB USERNAME>/base-theme.git

    # to clone the original repository
    git clone git@github.com:scandipwa/base-theme.git

    # to clone via HTTPS (not recommended)
    git clone https://github.com/scandipwa/base-theme.git
    ```

    > **Note**: sometimes, after the repository is cloned, the git chooses the `master` branch as default. This is the legacy (incorrect) default branch in case of `base-theme`. Please make sure you are using `2.x-stable`. You can do it using following command:

    ```bash
    git status # expected output `On branch 2.x-stable`
    ```

    If any other output has been returned, execute the following command to checkout the correct branch:

    ```bash
    git checkout 2.x-stable
    ```

    Later, for development purposes any new branch created from `2.x-stable` can be used.

2. From the cloned theme folder, execute following:

    ```bash
    npm ci # install dependencies
    npm run watch-core
    ```

### For custom theme development

> **Note**: initial setup must happen on real instance. After the bootstrapped theme is committed to the repository, you can proceed with this installation.

1. Create a new folder

2. Inside, clone your custom theme repository:

    ```bash
    git clone <CUSTOM THEME REPOSITORY GIT REMOTE>
    ```

3. Then, get matching `scandipwa/source` package version from [GitHub](https://github.com/scandipwa/base-theme) and clone it.

    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:scandipwa/base-theme.git
    ```

4. Validate the folder structure:

```bash
# from the folder created in step #1
ls

# should output
<NAME OF CUSTOM THEME>      base-theme
```

5. Time to update the webpack config (**DO NOT COMMIT THIS CHANGE!**):

    1. Go to `src/config/webpack.development.config`

    2. Open it with you favorite editor, and edit following lines:

        ```js
        // original file content
        const projectRoot = path.resolve(__dirname, '..', '..');
        const magentoRoot = path.resolve(projectRoot, '..', '..', '..', '..', '..');
        const fallbackRoot = path.resolve(magentoRoot, 'vendor', 'scandipwa', 'source');

        // resulting config
        const projectRoot = path.resolve(__dirname, '..', '..');
        const fallbackRoot = path.resolve(projectRoot, '..', 'base-theme');
        ```

        > **Note:** what you did is made the webpack to fallback to the cloned `base-theme` folder, instead of usual vendor file.

6. From the custom theme theme folder, execute following:

    ```bash
    npm ci # install dependencies
    npm run watch
    ```

## Time to open the site

1. Open your favorite browser, i.e. Google Chrome

2. Open un-secure [http://scandipwa.local](http://scandipwa.local) domain

> **Note**: in case you are getting CORS issues printed out in console, make sure to run chrome with disabled web-security flag set.

## Something does not work?

Follow this simple algorithm:

1. Refer to the [FAQ page](/setup/docker/faq.md). It most probably already has the solution to your problem.

    > **Note**: the Docker setup related issues are also mentioned in this document.

2. If the issue still persists, [join our community slack](https://join.slack.com/t/scandipwa/shared_invite/enQtNzE2Mjg1Nzg3MTg5LTQwM2E2NmQ0NmQ2MzliMjVjYjQ1MTFiYWU5ODAyYTYyMGQzNWM3MDhkYzkyZGMxYTJlZWI1N2ExY2Q1MDMwMTk), and feel free to ask questions in `#pwa_tech` public channel.

3. Alternatively [create an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/scandipwa/scandipwa-base/issues/new/choose) - however, the response time there will be a little-bit longer than in community Slack.
