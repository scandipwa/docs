# Building the infrastructure

Template is using as much of pre-builts and originally shipped images as possible, however, to maintain environment changes we are building APP service container, that contains application, PHP, composer, nodejs and other tools.

All services are defined within docker-compose.yml and can be enabled or disabled depending or project needs.
