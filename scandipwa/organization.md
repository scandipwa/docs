# Keeping the code consistent

The developers experience is great when the expectations are met. When I can spend time on feature implementation, rather than on debugging the "vendor-code" â€“ I rate the framework higher.

We concluded this very early on. Multiple decisions in ScandiPWA architecture were dictated by the ease-of-development and our educated observations of existing solutions.

Let me introduce you to the list of our findings, which sole goal is to improve the experience and make project's code more consistent.

## BEM

> **TODO**: Explain the necessity in this technology, other possible approaches, and the difference with the past M2 practice.

## Flat file structure

> **TODO**: Explain the necessity in this technology, other possible approaches. Provide the explanation great integrates of this approach with BEM.

## Postfix naming convention

> **TODO**: Explain the motivation, the benefit in conjunction with the flat file structure. Give use-full tips for daily coding.

## Technology simplicity and stability

> **TODO**: Explain the `npm ci` command, why do we keep the older versions of third-party libraries, why are not we using the latest React developments.
